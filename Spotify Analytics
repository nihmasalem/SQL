# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#Then I answered the following questions:

--1. What is the average danceability by artist and track?  
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY artist_name;

--2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10;

--3. What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 1;

--4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?  
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10;

--5. Which artist(s) has more than one song that is included in the list?
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >1;

--6. What are the top 5 songs and their artists that have the highest key?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, song_key
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_key DESC LIMIT 5;

--7. What 10 songs have the least energy score?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY energy ASC LIMIT 10;
