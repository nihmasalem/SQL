#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1. How many orders were placed in January?

--#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT Count(orderID)

WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND Product = "iPhone"
AND orderID <> ' ';

--#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;


--#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

--#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


--#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(price*quantity) as revenue, Product,
      location, price, Quantity
 FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';


--#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price) AS 'Avg Amount Spent'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
